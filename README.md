Form database bundle
====================
Saves all forms created using Contao's frontend form manager when they are submitted in the frontend.

Contao's "Store form data" function requires you to create a database table with columns that match the form fields. This extension will automatically save all form submissions and make them available to view in the backend in one place without having to create a dedicated table.
